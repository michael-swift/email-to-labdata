## Deployment Steps

1. **Run deployment script**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy_lambda.sh
   ```

2. **The script will**:
   - Build Docker image with new code
   - Push to ECR
   - Update Lambda function
   - Set environment variables (including OPENAI_API_KEY)

3. **Post-deployment testing**:
   - Send test email with single image
   - Send test email with multiple images
   - Verify CSV format and commentary
   - Check CloudWatch logs

## New Features in Production

1. **Email Response Format**:
   - Subject: "Nanodrop Results - RNA Analysis (5 samples, 1 image)"
   - Body includes LLM analysis summary
   - CSV attached with assay type column
   - Original images returned as attachments

2. **Handles Edge Cases**:
   - Negative concentrations flagged
   - Multiple images merged intelligently
   - Mixed assay types noted

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise, previous Lambda version can be restored in AWS Console.
